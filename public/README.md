# Bustabit Script Simulator
> Simulates your script on thousands of bustabit games, in a few seconds.



## Getting started
So you like to play bustabit? And you've written your own script?
You want to see if it's profitable in the long run? (it's not)

You can simulate your script on thousands of bustabit games, in a few seconds.

1. Go here: https://mtihc.github.io/bustabit-script-simulator/
2. Choose or write a script.
3. Configure the script
4. Run the script
5. View a summary of the simulation, including a line chart



## Features
- You can manage a list of scripts on the webpage, just like on bustabit.
- Stores scripts and their configurations in the browser's local storage, just like on bustabit.
- Parses the `var config = ...` object at the top of the script, into a user interface that is used to configure and drive the script, just like on bustabit. (read more about this on [bustabit's autobet repository](https://github.com/bustabit/autobet)).
- Exposes the following variables to the script, just like on bustabit:
  - `config`
  - `engine`
  - `userInfo`
  - `log(message: string)`
  - `stop(reason: string)`
  - `notify(message: string)`
- The engine behaves as much as possible like the one on bustabit.
- The engine provides much of the same interface as the one on bustabit.
    - `engine.bet(wager: number, payout: number)`
    - `engine.history`
    - `engine.on(eventName: string, callback: function)`
    - `engine.gameState`
    - `engine.next`
    - `engine._userInfo`
- The engine emits the same events as the one on bustabit.
    - `GAME_STARTING` 
    - `GAME_STARTED`
    - `GAME_ENDED`
    - `BET_PLACED`
    - `CASHED_OUT`

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### How are the game results generated?
Bustabit is provably fair. If you have the *hash* of one game, you can calculate the result of that game and all games before it. This concept is explained on bustabit.com

##### So, the game results are the same as on bustabit?
Yes, as long as you copy a real game *hash* from a bustabit game.

##### Are the game results in the same order as on bustabit?
Yes. The game results have to be calculated backwards from the input *hash*. But the simulation runs in regular order.

##### Did you copy the engine from bustabit?
No. I didn't copy any code. I made a dumbed-down `engine` from scratch which behaves as much as possible like the one on bustabit.

##### Can I send you money?
Yes. You can [send me a tip on bustabit](https://www.bustabit.com/tip). My username is **Mtihc**. Or [via paypal](https://www.paypal.me/MitchStoffels).

##### Why would I want to send you money?
Because you're nice.
